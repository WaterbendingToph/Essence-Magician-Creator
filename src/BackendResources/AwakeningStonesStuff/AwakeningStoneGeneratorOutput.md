Remember, there are 6 affinities at common and one fewer with every step up in rarity until just one with the legendary awakening stones
Also, the name is a 40 character varchar and a plural if that of a living thing or one object
Rarities and popularities are('common', 'uncommon', 'rare', 'epic', 'legendary') and if this is one of the equivalent stones for an essence than it uses that rarity and popularity
Affinities are('special ability', 'drain', 'familiar', 'ritual', 'special attack', 'conjuration', 'spell', 'summoning', 'puppet', 'aura', 'execute', 'counter-execute', 'perception', 'channeling', 'dimension', 'teleport', 'looting', 'combination', 'movement', 'instantaneous movement') 
It is also worth noting that anything with a casting time over 1 action is a spell of some kind because it has an incantation. So choosing spell also increases the pool to include ritual, familiar summoning, conjuration, summoning, puppet, channeling, teleport, looting, and drain types
Those other types don't necessarily have to be spells though if they only have 1 action or shorter casting times
Listing movement as an affinity does also include instaneous movement as less than half the time that type as well
Combination abilites have to be stacking on either special attacks, movement, or special abilities. They're 50/40/10 - respectively so combination will also be 1 of those 3
Ritual abilities are usually familiar summonings, but can also be ritual-related abilities in the form of other ability types, and least likely to be dedicated ritual abilities
Also, the affinites are assumed to be evenly weighted between all of them, so no need to order them from highest to rarest affinity
